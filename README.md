This is Espressif Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh component cloned repository.  

The ESP-BLE-MESH networking enables many-to-many (m:m) device communications and is optimized for creating large-scale device networks.

This ESP-BLE-MESH component has ChaCha20-Poly1305 integrated as an AEAD algorithm instead of standard AES-CCM.
